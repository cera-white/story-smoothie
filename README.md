# Story Smoothie

This is a program for randomly generating story ideas based on [Abbie Emmons' "story smoothie" method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCVZt9qIgec).

The basic concept is that you choose one piece of media you enjoy for each of the following categories:
- Genre (setting + time period + vibe)
- Plot (irresistable premise, the hook, the setup for external events)
- Characters (personality + relationships)
- Theme (the big idea, overarching message)

Mix them together and you have a unique story idea!


## How to Use
1. Update `ingredients.list` with a list of your favorite media titles. These can be TV shows, books, movies, videogames, or anything else that tells a story.
2. Run `ruby mixer.rb` to mix together your story smoothie based on randomly chosen ingredients from Step 1.
3. Retry Step 2 until you find something that gets your creative juices flowing.
4. Write your story!


## Future Improvements
* For each "ingredient", include a link to Wikipedia or other site for easy reference.
* For each "ingredient", include short summary of Genre, Plot, Characters, and Theme for easy reference.
